# Weather-Board

## Description

An app designed to use OpenWeather API and DayJS to help users see the five day forecast and local times in cities they may want to visit. The app will also store the previous five cities the user has input and clicking on them will quickly switch them back to their five day forecast. In creating this application I wanted to make a quick way to view several cities weather forecast without having keep looking for cities I have already checked. In creating sections for form submission, the user can search for their sesired city. The user will also be met with icons and displays regarding the weather that is occurring in that city.
